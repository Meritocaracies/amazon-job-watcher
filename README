# Amazon Job Watcher

_Automated job posting tracker for Amazon (or any site), with instant Discord notifications._

---

## Overview

I built this project because I kept missing job postings for my local Amazon fulfillment center. They often disappeared within **30–45 minutes**, while existing trackers updated only every 3–6 hours (unless you paid).  

This watcher monitors a job listings page in real time and sends a **Discord notification** as soon as it changes. Thanks to this, I got notified instantly and landed a job within a few days.

## Features

- Uses **Playwright** for browser automation  
- Detects **site changes** via hashing  
- Sends **Discord webhook notifications**  
- Works locally, on servers, or via **GitHub Actions**  
- Can be adapted to track **any website**, not just Amazon

## Example
